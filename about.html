            <p>
              I grew up in a medium income house. Had my first Desktop computer
              when i was in secondary and i fell inlove with how it was able to
              perform a lot of tasks. I am talking about tasks like editing a
              document, presenation, taking photo as well as videos, playing
              music and storing files in folders. After that experience of using
              the computer at home i realized that i saw that i can also become
              a coder. I studied in a science and mathematics secondary called
              Mbilwi Secondary School in Sibasa. I matriculated in 2007 and went
              to University of Pretoria(Tuks) to study B.Eng Electronic
              Engineering influenced by my father who is an electrician. During
              my stay at Tuks, i managed to research about a coding degree and i
              found they offer Bsc Computer science which i liked but was unable
              to change immediately hence i deregistered engineering. I came
              back in 2016 at University of Limpopo where i did Bsc Mathematical
              sciences and graduated in 2019. I tried to major in subjects that
              relate to Bsc Computer Science awhich where Computer Science and
              Statistics. After that i spent 18 months training to be a Data
              Scientist first with Deviare and then Explore Data Science
              Academy. I was not successful finding a job in Data Science and
              hence I am currently doing training to become a Software Developer
              with The Digital Academy.
